Corpus: The Politics of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland takes place in the framework of a constitutional monarchy in which the Monarch is head of state and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government.

Word: monarchy

The result: Monarchy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy, A monarchy is a form of government in which a group generally a group of people representing a dynasty (aristocracy) embodies the country's national identity and its head the monarch exercises the role of supreme sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic) to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy) to completely autocratic (absolute monarchy). Traditionally the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast elective monarchies require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example in some elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion age gender mental capacity etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed for instance.Monarchic rule was the most common form of government until the 19th century. It is now usually a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution others have governing authority. Currently 45 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state 16 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. Most modern European monarchies are constitutional and hereditary with a largely ceremonial role with the exception of the Vatican which is an elective theocracy and the Principalities of Liechtenstein and Monaco where the monarchs exercise unrestricted authority. The monarchies of Cambodia and Malaysia are constitutional with a largely ceremonial role despite possessing significantly more social and legal clout than their European counterparts. The monarchs of Brunei Morocco Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and Eswatini have more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations either by tradition or a constitutional mandate.

Corpus: A senate is a deliberative body often the upper house or chamber of a legislature. There have been many such bodies in history the first of which was the Roman Senate.

Word: senate

The result: Senate, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate, A senate is a deliberative assembly often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus) so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning "the elder" or "old man") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class. Thus the literal meaning of the word "senate" is Assembly of Elders.Many countries have an assembly named a senate composed of senators who may be elected appointed have inherited the title or gained membership by other methods depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of "sober second thought" to consider legislation passed by a lower house whose members are usually elected. Most senates have asymmetrical duties and powers compared with their respective lower house meaning they have special duties for example to fill important political positions or to pass special laws. Conversely many senates have limited powers in changing or stopping bills under consideration and efforts to stall or veto a bill may be bypassed by the lower house or another branch of government.

Corpus: Rules of Prudence are designed to serve self interest. Do not drink the cleaning solution would be a rule of prudence. This rule would be not considered a moral rule because while it is not morally wrong to drink cleaning solution it does serve your best interest not to do so.

Word: solution

The result: Solution, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution, In chemistry a solution is a special type of homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. The term aqueous solution is when one of the solvents is water. In such a mixture a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance known as a solvent. The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation. The solution assumes the phase of the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture as is commonly the case.  The concentration of a solute in a solution is the mass of that solute expressed as a percentage of the mass of the whole solution.

Corpus: Although prudence would be applied to any such judgement the more difficult tasks which distinguish a person as prudent are those in which various goods have to be weighed against each other as when a person is determining what would be best to give charitable donations or how to punish a child so as to prevent repeating an offense.

Word: prudence

The result: Prudence, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence, Prudence (Latin: prudentia contracted from providentia meaning "seeing ahead sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason. It is classically considered to be a virtue and in particular one of the four Cardinal virtues (which are with the three theological virtues part of the seven virtues). Prudentia is an allegorical female personification of the virtue whose attributes are a mirror and snake who is frequently depicted as a pair with Justitia the Roman goddess of Justice.The word derives from the 14th-century Old French word prudence which in turn derives from the Latin prudentia meaning "foresight sagacity". It is often associated with wisdom insight and knowledge.  In this case the virtue is the ability to judge between virtuous and vicious actions not only in a general sense but with regard to appropriate actions at a given time and place. Although prudence itself does not perform any actions and is concerned solely with knowledge all virtues had to be regulated by it. Distinguishing when acts are courageous as opposed to reckless or cowardly is an act of prudence and for this reason it is classified as a cardinal (pivotal) virtue.In modern English the word has become increasingly synonymous with cautiousness.  In this sense prudence names a reluctance to take risks which remains a virtue with respect to unnecessary risks but when unreasonably extended into over-cautiousness can become the vice of cowardice.In the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle gives a lengthy account of the virtue phronesis (Ancient Greek: ϕρόνησις) traditionally translated as "prudence" although this has become increasingly problematic as the word has fallen out of common usage.  More recently ϕρόνησις has been translated by such terms as "practical wisdom" "practical judgment" or "rational choice".

And those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.

Word: stage

The result: Sound stage, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage, In common usage a sound stage (also written soundstage) is a soundproof hangar-like structure building or room used for the production of theatrical film-making and television productions usually located on a secured movie or television studio property. A sound stage should not be confused with a silent stage. A sound stage is sound-proofed so that sound can be recorded along with the images. The recordings are known as "production sound."  A silent stage is not soundproofed and is susceptible to outside noise interference and so sound is not generally recorded. Because most sound in movies including dialogue is added in post-production this generally means that the main difference between the two is that sound stages are used for dialogue scenes but silent stages are not.  An alternative to production sound is to record additional dialogue during post-production using a technique known as dubbing.

Word: set

The result: Age set, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_set, In anthropology an age set is a social category or corporate social group consisting of people of similar age who have a common identity maintain close ties over a prolonged period and together pass through a series of age-related statuses. This is in contrast to an age grade through which people pass individually over time.While a year group or class in a school could be regarded as a simple example of an age set (e.g. 'Class of 2004') the term is most commonly used to refer to systems in tribal societies. The phenomenon is most prevalent in East Africa central Brazil and parts of New Guinea where in many societies the importance of social groupings based on age eclipses that of social groupings based on kinship and descent. Age sets in these societies are formed by the periodic grouping together of young people—usually men—into a corporate unit with a name and a collective identity. As its members age the set stays together and increases in seniority as older sets die off and new ones are formed beneath it.Age sets and the systems within which they exist can be regarded as either cyclical or progressive. In a cyclical system there is a finite number of sets and each recurs over the course of a few generations with new membership. In progressive systems an age set appears once and when its members have died it ceases to exist. It is often the case that cultures with either cyclical or progressive systems have equivalent ideas about cosmology and the nature of time.

Word: land

The result: Land, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land, Land sometimes referred to as dry land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently covered by water. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture habitat and various natural resources. Some life forms (including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals) have developed from predecessor species that lived in bodies of water.Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.

All-encompassing kennel clubs are also referred to as 'all-breed clubs' although "all" means only those breeds that they have decided to recognize and "breed"  means purebred dogs not including dog hybrids and crossbreeds or mixed-breed dogs.   A club that handles only one breed is known as a breed club.

Corpus: The North Shore Line was opened on 1 January 1890 as a single track between Hornsby and St Leonards. The line was extended to the Sydney Harbour foreshore at Milsons Point on 1 May 1893. Transport between this original Milsons Point station and central Sydney was by ferry boat.

Word: transport

The result: Transport, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport, Transport or transportation is the movement of humans animals and goods from one location to another. In other words the action of transportation is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to the Point B.  Modes of transport include air land (rail and road) water cable pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure vehicles and operations. Transport is important because it enables trade between people which is essential for the development of civilizations.Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations including roads railways airways waterways canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports railway stations bus stations warehouses trucking terminals refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles bicycles buses trains trucks helicopters watercraft spacecraft and aircraft.Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated and the procedures set for this purpose including financing legalities and policies. In the transport industry operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private depending on the country and mode.Passenger transport may be public where operators provide scheduled services or private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land. While it is heavily subsidized by governments good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl.

The result: Construction, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction, Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning design and financing; it continues until the project is built and ready for use.Large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines. A project manager normally manages the job and a construction manager design engineer construction engineer or architect supervises it. Those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements environmental impact of the job scheduling budgeting construction-site safety availability and transportation of building materials logistics inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding. Large construction projects are sometimes referred to as megaprojects.

Corpus: The Bulgaria national football team is the national football team of Bulgaria and is controlled by the Bulgarian Football Union.

Word: team

The result: Team, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team, A team is a group of individuals working together to achieve their goal. As defined by professor Leigh Thompson of the Kellogg School of Management " A team is a group of people who are interdependent with respect to information resources and skills and who seek to combine their efforts to achieve a common goal." A group does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills and generate synergy through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Naresh Jain (2009) claims:Team members need to learn how to help one another help other team members realize their true potential and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond his or her limitations. Teams can be broken down into from a huge team or one big group of people even if these smaller secondary teams are temporary.A team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.Thus teams of game players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport. Transport logistics executives can select teams of horses dogs or oxen for the purpose of conveying passengers or goods.While academic research on teams and teamwork has grown consistently and has shown a sharp increase over the past recent 40 years the societal diffusion of teams and teamwork actually followed a volatile trend in the 20th century. The concept was introduced into business in the late 20th century which was followed by a popularization of the concept of constructing teams.  Differing opinions exist on the efficacy of this new management fad.Some see "team" as a four-letter word:  overused and under-useful.Others see it as a panacea that realizes the human-relations movement's desire to integrate what that movement perceives as best for workers and as best for managers.  Still others believe in the effectiveness of teams but also see them as dangerous because of the potential for exploiting workers — in that team effectiveness can rely on peer pressure and peer surveillance. However Hackman argued that team effectiveness should not be viewed only in terms of performance. While performance is an important outcome a truly effective team will contribute to the personal well-being and adaptive growth of its members.Team is a prevalent word that is used in today’s society to describe many types of groups. Gaining insight from Leadership: Theory & Practice by Peter Guy Northouse helped to understand the word team from a leadership perspective. According to the team approach on leadership a team is a type of organizational group of people that are members. A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other work towards interchangeable achievements and share common attainments. A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization company or community. Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties. A team’s communication is significantly important to their relationship. Ergo communication is frequent and persistent and as well are the meetings. The definition of team being an organizational group is not completely set in stone as organizations have confronted a myriad of new forms of contemporary collaboration. Teams usually have strong organizational structured platforms and respond quickly and efficiently to challenges as they have skills and the capability to do so. An effective organizational team leads to greater productivity more effective implementation of resources better decisions and problem-solving better-quality products/service and greater innovation and originality.Compare the more structured/skilled concept of a crew the advantages of formal and informal partnerships or the well-defined - but time-limited - existence of task forces.

Corpus: A gamma camera is a device used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes a technique known as scintigraphy.

Word: emitting

The result: Light-emitting diode, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode, A light-emitting diode (LED) is a  semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. When a current flows through the diode electrons are able to recombine with electron holes within the device releasing energy in the form of photons. This effect is called electroluminescence. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy band gap of the semiconductor. White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962 the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light.Infrared LEDs are still frequently used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the visible ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths with high light output.Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps replacing small incandescent bulbs and in seven-segment displays. Recent developments have produced  white-light LEDs suitable for room lighting. LEDs have led to new displays and sensors while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology.LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption longer lifetime improved physical robustness smaller size and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are used in applications as diverse as aviation lighting automotive headlamps advertising general lighting traffic signals camera flashes lighted wallpaper and medical devices.Unlike a laser the color of light emitted from an LED is neither coherent nor monochromatic but the spectrum is narrow with respect to human vision and functionally monochromatic.

Corpus: Hal Anger developed the first gamma camera in 1957. His original design frequently called the Anger camera is still widely used today. The Anger camera uses sets of vacuum tube photomultipliers.

Word: anger

The result: Anger, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger, Anger or wrath is an intense expression of emotion. It involves a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation hurt or threat. Anger can occur when a person feels their personal boundaries are being or are about to be violated.  Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation as a way of coping. Raymond Novaco of University of California Irvine who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals) somatic-affective (tension and agitations) and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism). William DeFoore an anger management writer described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.A person experiencing anger will often experience physical conditions such as increased heart rate elevated blood pressure and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the fight or flight brain response. Anger is used as a protective mechanism to cover up fear hurt or sadness. Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally cognitively and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force. The English term originally comes from the term anger of Old Norse language. Anger can have many physical and mental consequences.The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions body language physiological responses and at times public acts of aggression. Facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown. Some animals for example make loud sounds attempt to look physically larger bare their teeth and stare. The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants. While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of "what has happened to them" psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.Modern psychologists view anger as a primary natural and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times and as something that has functional value for survival. Anger is seen as a supportive mechanism to show a person that something is wrong and requires changing. Anger can mobilize psychological resources for corrective action. Uncontrolled anger can however negatively affect personal or social well-being  and impact negatively on those around them. It is equally challenging to be around an angry person and the impact can also cause psychological/emotional trauma if not dealt with. While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger. The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers but modern psychologists in contrast to earlier writers have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger. Displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence.

Corpus: Almost all the music was composed by the trio.

Word: composed

The result: Through-composed, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-composed, In music theory about musical form through-composed music is relatively continuous non-sectional or non-repetitive music. A song is said to be through-composed if it has different music for each stanza of the lyrics. This is in contrast to strophic form in which each stanza is set to the same music. Sometimes the German durchkomponiert is used to indicate the same concept. Musicologist James Webster says of the term:In general usage a 'through-composed' work is one based on run-on movements without internal repetitions. (The distinction is especially characteristic of the literature of the art-song where such works are contrasted with strophic settings.)Many examples of this form can be found in Schubert's Lieder where the words of a poem are set to music and each line is different for example in his Lied "Der Erlkönig" ("The Elf King") in which the setting proceeds to a different musical arrangement for each new stanza and whenever the piece comes to each character the character portrays its own voice register and tonality. Another example is Haydn's 'Farewell Symphony'.A good deal of Captain Beefheart's oeuvre is through-composed. No section of Ary Barroso's 1939 samba "Brazil" repeats; however a second set of lyrics in Portuguese allows the melody to be sung through twice.

They are bound together in a union with each other each holding governmental jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and sharing its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (e.g. paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names.States are divided into counties or county-equivalents which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state and states may also create other local governments. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions.

Word: state

The result: U.S. state, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state, In the United States a state is a constituent political entity of which there are currently 50. They are bound together in a union with each other each holding governmental jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory and sharing its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (e.g. paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names.States are divided into counties or county-equivalents which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign. County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state and states may also create other local governments. State governments are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual constitutions.

A committee might also be denoted as a council though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body while a council may not be. Because many schools have a student council the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants.A member of a council may be referred to as a councillor or councilperson or by the gender-specific titles of councilman and councilwoman.

Word: erection

The result: Erection, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection, An erection (clinically: penile erection or penile tumescence) is a physiological phenomenon in which the penis becomes firm engorged and enlarged. Penile erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological neural vascular and endocrine factors and is often associated with sexual arousal or sexual attraction although erections can also be spontaneous. The shape angle and direction of an erection varies considerably in humans.Physiologically erection is triggered by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system causing nitric oxide (a  vasodilator) levels to rise in the  trabecular arteries and smooth muscle of the penis. The arteries  dilate causing the corpora cavernosa of the penis (and to a lesser extent the corpus spongiosum) to fill with blood; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic activity reduces to baseline.As an autonomic nervous system response an erection may result from a variety of stimuli including sexual stimulation and sexual arousal and is therefore not entirely under conscious control. Erections during sleep or upon waking up are known as nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). Absence of nocturnal erection is commonly used to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of erectile dysfunction and impotence.The state of a penis which is partly but not fully erect is sometimes known as semi-erection (clinically: partial tumescence); a penis which is not erect is typically referred to as being flaccid or soft.

Word: abstract

The result: Abstraction, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction, Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers first principles or other methods.  "An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as a group field or category.Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior excluding but not eliminating the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball. In a type–token distinction a type (e.g. a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g. 'that leather soccer ball').Abstraction in its secondary use is a material process discussed in the themes below.

Word: led

The result: LED lamp, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_lamp, A LED lamp or LED light bulb is an electric light for use in light fixtures that produces light using light-emitting diode (LED). LED lamps have a lifespan many times longer than equivalent incandescent lamps and are significantly more efficient than most fluorescent lamps with some LED chips able to emit up to 303 lumens per watt (as claimed by Cree and some other LED manufacturers).  However LED lamps require an electronic LED driver circuit when operated from mains power lines and losses from this circuit mean the efficiency of the lamp is lower than the efficiency of the LED chips it uses.  The most efficient commercially available LED lamps have efficiencies of 200 lumens per watt (lm/w). Commercially available LED chips have efficiencies of over 220 lm/w. The LED lamp market is projected to grow by more than twelve-fold over the next decade from $2 billion in the beginning of 2014 to $25 billion in 2023 a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. As of  2016 LEDs use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.Similar to incandescent lamps and unlike most fluorescent lamps (e.g. tubes and compact fluorescent lamps or CFLs) LEDs come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time; the life of fluorescent lighting is also reduced by frequent switching on and off. The initial cost of LED is usually higher. Degradation of LED dye and packaging materials reduces light output to some extent over time.Some LED lamps are made to be a directly compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps. An LED lamp packaging may show the lumen output power consumption in watts color temperature in kelvins or description (e.g. "warm white" "cool white" or "daylight") operating temperature range and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp of similar luminous output.Most LEDs do not emit light in all directions and their directional characteristics affect the design of lamps although omnidirectional lamps which radiate light over a 360° angle are becoming more common. The light output of single LED is less than that of incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps; in most applications multiple LEDs are used to form a lamp although high-power versions are becoming available.LEDs as their name suggests operate as diodes and run on direct current (DC) whereas mains current is alternating current (AC) and usually at much higher voltage than the LED can accept. Although low voltage LED lamps are available LED lamps can contain a circuit for converting the mains AC into DC at the correct voltage. These circuits contain rectifiers capacitors and may have other active electronic components which may or may not permit the lamp to be dimmed.

Corpus: The Ottomans had relative tolerance for different cultures and religions. The men of the ruling dynasty took wives from various ethnic groups and thus were of mixed ethnic and cultural heritage.

Word: relative

The result: Relativizer, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativizer, In linguistics a relativizer (abbreviated REL)  is a type of conjunction that introduces a relative clause.  For example in English the conjunction that may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as "I have one that you can use." Relativizers do not appear at least overtly in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases a "zero relativizer" may be present meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing. For example the word that can be omitted in the above English example producing "I have one you can use" using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer.

The result: Greaser (derogatory), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greaser_(derogatory), Greaser was a derogatory term for a Mexican in what is now the U.S. Southwest in the 19th century. The slur likely derived from what was considered one of the lowliest occupations typically held by Mexicans the greasing of the axles of wagons; they also greased animal hides that were taken to California where Mexicans loaded them onto clipper ships (a greaser). It was in common usage among U.S. troops during the Mexican–American War.The term was actually incorporated into an early California statute the Greaser Act (1855) an expression of a virulent form of anti-Mexican sentiment among many Anglo Californians.Greaser persisted in use through the silent movie era as evidenced by movies such as Ah Sing and the Greasers (1910) The Greaser's Gauntlet (1908)Tony the Greaser (1911) The Greaser and the Weakling (1912) The Girl and the Greaser (1913) The Greaser's Revenge (1914) and Bronco Billy and the Greaser (1914).

However some modern-century philosophers have interpreted temporality in ways other than this linear manner. Examples would be McTaggart's The Unreality of Time Husserl's analysis of internal time consciousness Martin Heidegger's Being and Time (1927) George Herbert Mead's Philosophy of the Present (1932) and Jacques Derrida's criticisms of Husserl's analysis as well as Nietzsche's eternal return of the same though this latter pertains more to historicity to which temporality gives rise.In social sciences temporality is also studied with respect to human's perception of time and the social organization of time. The perception of time undergoes significant change in the three hundred years between the Middle Ages and Modernity.

Track was re-laid in 1933 as well as single-ended double-decker tramcars purchased to serve on this particular line. Indeed the line was built with loop termini. The tramcars used for the Sheffield - Rotherham service were equipped with only one entrance and staircase and like on traditional double-decker bus es seats were made to be comfortable.

Word: loop

The result: For loop, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop, In computer science a for-loop (or simply for loop)  is a control flow statement for specifying iteration which allows code to be executed repeatedly. Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of ALGOL use "for" while descendants of Fortran use "do". There are other possibilities for example COBOL which uses "PERFORM VARYING".A for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration and a body which is executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable.The name for-loop comes from the English word for which is used as the keyword in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. The term in English dates to ALGOL 58 and was popularized in the influential later ALGOL 60; it is the direct translation of the earlier German für used in Superplan (1949–1951) by Heinz Rutishauser who also was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. The loop body is executed "for" the given values of the loop variable though this is more explicit in the ALGOL version of the statement in which a list of possible values and/or increments can be specified.In FORTRAN and PL/I the keyword DO is used for the same thing and it is called a do-loop; this is different from a do-while loop.

Corpus: The SS Manhattan was an oil tanker that became the first commercial ship to cross the Northwest Passage in 1969. For this voyage she was refitted with an icebreaker bow.

Word: tanker

The result: Oil tanker, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker, An oil tanker also known as a petroleum tanker is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. Product tankers generally much smaller are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.Oil tankers are often classified by their size as well as their occupation. The size classes range from inland or coastal tankers of a few thousand metric tons of deadweight (DWT) to the mammoth ultra large crude carriers (ULCCs) of 550000 DWT. Tankers move approximately 2000000000 metric tons (2.2×109 short tons) of oil every year. Second only to pipelines in terms of efficiency the average cost of oil transport by tanker amounts to only two or three United States cents per 1 US gallon (3.8 L).Some specialized types of oil tankers have evolved. One of these is the naval replenishment oiler a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard oil tanker design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.

Word: transport

The result: Transport, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport, Transport or transportation is the movement of humans animals and goods from one location to another. In other words the action of transportation is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to the Point B.  Modes of transport include air land (rail and road) water cable pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure vehicles and operations. Transport is important because it enables trade between people which is essential for the development of civilizations.Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations including roads railways airways waterways canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports railway stations bus stations warehouses trucking terminals refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles bicycles buses trains trucks helicopters watercraft spacecraft and aircraft.Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated and the procedures set for this purpose including financing legalities and policies. In the transport industry operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private depending on the country and mode.Passenger transport may be public where operators provide scheduled services or private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land. While it is heavily subsidized by governments good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl.

At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2) the United States is the world's third or fourth largest country by total area and slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe's 3.9 million square miles (10.1 million km2). With a population of over 327 million people the U.S. is the third most populous country. The capital is Washington D.C. and the largest city by population is New York. Forty-eight states and the capital's federal district are contiguous in North America between Canada and Mexico. The State of Alaska is in the northwest corner of North America bordered by Canada to the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west. The State of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea stretching across nine official time zones. The extremely diverse geography climate and wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries.Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 15000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies following the French and Indian War led to the American Revolution which began in 1775 and the subsequent Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a European power. The current constitution was adopted in 1788 with the first ten amendments collectively named the Bill of Rights being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century acquiring new territories displacing Native American tribes and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery. By the end of the century the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean and its economy driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution began to soar. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower the first country to develop nuclear weapons the only country to use them in warfare and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. During the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race culminating with the 1969 Moon landing. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law". The United States is a founding member of the United Nations World Bank International Monetary Fund Organization of American States (OAS) and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. The United States is the world's largest importer and the second largest exporter of goods by value. Although its population is only 4.3% of the world total the U.S. holds 33% of the total wealth in the world the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance including human development per capita GDP and productivity per person while experiencing a substantial amount of income and wealth inequality. The United States is the foremost military power in the world making up a third of global military spending and is a leading political cultural and scientific force internationally.

The result: Extreme programming, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming, Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review unit testing of all code avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed a flat management structure code simplicity and clarity expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme code can be reviewed continuously i.e. the practice of pair programming.

Word: train

The result: Train, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train, A train is a form of transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally runs along a rail track to transport cargo or passengers. The word "train" comes from the Old French trahiner derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull" or "to draw".Motive power for a train is provided by a separate locomotive or individual motors in a self-propelled multiple unit. Although historically steam propulsion dominated the most common types of locomotive are diesel and electric the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Trains can also be hauled by horses pulled by engine or water-driven cable or wire winch run downhill using gravity or powered by pneumatics gas turbines or batteries.Train tracks usually consist of two running rails sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails. Monorails and maglev guideways are also used occasionally.A passenger train includes passenger-carrying vehicles and can often be very long and fast. One notable and growing long-distance train category is high-speed rail. In order to achieve much faster operation at speeds of over 500 km/h (310 mph) innovative maglev technology has been the subject of research for many years. The term "light rail" is sometimes used to refer to a modern tram system but it may also mean an intermediate form between a tram and a train similar to a heavy rail rapid transit system. In most countries the distinction between a tramway and a railway is precise and defined in law.A freight train (or goods train) uses freight cars (or wagons/trucks) to transport goods or materials (cargo). It is possible to carry passengers and freight in the same train using a mixed consist.Rail cars and machinery that are used for the maintenance and repair of tracks are termed "maintenance of way" equipment; these may be assembled into maintenance of way trains. Similarly dedicated trains may be used to provide support services to stations along a train line such as garbage or revenue collection.

Word: breed

The result: Breed, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed, A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype) homogeneous behavior and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry and agriculture no single scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.When bred together individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring and this ability – known as "breeding true" – is a requirement for a breed. Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species subspecies botanical variety even different genera) are referred to as hybrids.

Corpus: Boulsworth Hill is a large expanse of moorland the highest point of the South Pennines of south-eastern Lancashire separating the District of Pendle from Calderdale.

Word: point

The result: Dew point, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point, The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapour. When further cooled the airborne water vapor will condense to form liquid water (dew). When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air water will condense on the surface. When the temperature is below the freezing point of water the dew point is called the frost point as frost is formed rather than dew. The measurement of the dew point is related to humidity. A higher dew point means there will be more moisture in the air.

Word: practices

The result: The Practice, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice, The Practice  is an American legal drama created by David E. Kelley centering on the partners and associates at a Boston law firm. Running for eight seasons on ABC from March 4 1997 to May 16 2004 the show won the Emmy in 1998 and 1999 for Best Drama Series and spawned the spin-off series Boston Legal which ran for five more seasons from 2004 to 2008.The Practice focused on the law firm of Robert Donnell and Associates (later becoming Donnell Young Dole & Frutt; Donnell Young & Frutt; and ultimately Young Frutt & Berluti). Plots typically featured the firm's involvement in various high-profile criminal and civil cases that often mirror current events. Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme. Some episodes contained light comedy. Kelley claimed that he conceived the show as something of a rebuttal to L.A. Law (for which he wrote) and its romanticized treatment of the American legal system and legal proceedings.

Corpus: The course prepares students for a wide variety of careers and requires students with a solid general knowledge and an ability both to sum up situations and offer suitable responses.

Word: solid

The result: Solid, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid, Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being liquid gas and plasma). In solids molecules are closely packed. It is characterized by structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume. Unlike  liquid a solid object does not flow to take on the shape of its container nor does it expand to fill the entire volume available to it like a gas does. The atoms in a solid are tightly bound to each other either in a regular geometric lattice (crystalline solids which include metals and ordinary ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass). Solids cannot be compressed with little pressure whereas gases can be compressed with little pressure because in gases molecules are loosely packed.The branch of physics that deals with solids is called solid-state physics and is the main branch of condensed matter physics (which also includes liquids). Materials science is primarily concerned with the physical and chemical properties of solids. Solid-state chemistry is especially concerned with the synthesis of novel materials as well as the science of identification and chemical composition.

Word: annexed

The result: Annexation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation, Annexation (Latin ad to and nexus joining) is the administrative action and concept in international law relating to the forcible acquisition of one state's territory by another state. It is generally held to be an illegal act. It is distinct from conquest which refers to the acquisition of control over a territory involving a change of sovereignty and differs from cession in which territory is given or sold through treaty since annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state. It usually follows military occupation of a territory.Annexation can be legitimized via general recognition by international bodies (i.e. other countries and intergovernmental organisations).

Corpus: A variable may also be declared as fully dynamic using the generic keyword. In this case no value need be assigned to it at declaration time

Word: declared

The result: Declared death in absentia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declared_death_in_absentia, A person may be legally declared dead in absentia i.e. a legal presumption of death may be declared despite the absence of direct proof of the person's death such as the finding of remains (e.g. a corpse or skeleton) attributable to that person. Such a declaration is typically made when a person has been missing for an extended period of time and in the absence of any evidence that the person is still alive – or after a much shorter period but where the circumstances surrounding a person's disappearance overwhelmingly support the belief that the person has died (e.g. an airplane crash).A declaration that a person is dead resembles other forms of "preventive adjudication" such as the declaratory judgment.  Different jurisdictions have different legal standards for obtaining such a declaration and in some jurisdictions a legal presumption of death may arise after a person has been missing under certain circumstances and a certain amount of time.

Corpus: Closures and coroutines A closure in Aikido is an object that contains everything that is needed to invoke a function from any point in the program. This includes the function's static link chain. A closure is created by passing a function name as an argument or by returning it from a function.

Word: argument

The result: Argument, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument, In logic and philosophy an argument is a series of statements (in a natural language) called the premises or premisses (both spellings are acceptable) intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement the conclusion. The logical form of an argument in a natural language can be represented in a symbolic formal language and independently of natural language formally defined "arguments" can be made in math and computer science.Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments. Deductive arguments can be valid or sound: in a valid argument premisses necessitate the conclusion even if one or more of the premisses is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument true premisses necessitate a true conclusion.  Inductive arguments by contrast can have different degrees of logical strength:  the stronger or more cogent the argument the greater the probability that the conclusion is true the weaker the argument the lesser that probability. The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth—for example the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in transcendental arguments the quality of hypotheses in retroduction or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.

Corpus: As was common in the political unrest of the 20th century the Red Terror was answered by a wave of counter-reprisals once the Communist leadership fled.

Word: wave

The result: Wave, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave, In physics a wave is a disturbance that transfers energy through matter or space with little or no associated mass transport (Mass transfer). Waves consist of oscillations or vibrations of a physical medium or a field around relatively fixed locations. From the perspective of mathematics waves as functions of time and space are a class of signals.There are two main types of waves: mechanical and electromagnetic. Mechanical waves propagate through a physical matter whose substance is being deformed. Restoring forces then reverse the deformation. For example sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbours. When the molecules collide they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave. Electromagnetic waves do not require a medium. Instead they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles and can therefore travel through a vacuum. These types vary in wavelength and include radio waves microwaves infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation X-rays and gamma rays.Waves are described by a wave equation which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time. The mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave. Further the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics are described by waves. In addition gravitational waves also travel through space which are a result of a vibration or movement in gravitational fields.A wave can be transverse where a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer or longitudinal: the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. While mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal all electromagnetic waves are transverse in free space.

Word: feature

The result: Feature film, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film, A feature film or theatrical film is a film (also called a motion picture or movie) with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole film to fill a program. The term feature film originally referred to the main full-length film in a cinema program that also included a short film and often a newsreel. The notion of how long a feature film should be has varied according to time and place. According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the American Film Institute and the British Film Institute a feature film runs for at least 40 minutes while the Screen Actors Guild asserts that a feature's running time is 80 minutes or longer.Most feature films are between 70 and 210 minutes long. The first narrative feature film was the 60-minute The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906 Australia). The first (proto)-feature-length adaptation was Les Misérables (1909 U.S.). Other early feature films include The Inferno (L'Inferno) (1911) Defence of Sevastopol (1911) Quo Vadis? (1913) Oliver Twist (1912) Richard III (1912) From the Manger to the Cross (1912) and Cleopatra (1912).
